\title{'ggdark': Dark mode for 'ggplot2'}
\description{
Use dark_mode() on your favorite 'ggplot2' theme to activate its dark mode.
'ggdark' also provides dark versions of the themes included in 'ggplot2':
dark_theme_grey(), dark_theme_bw(), dark_theme_minimal(), and others. When a
dark theme is applied, all geom color and geom fill defaults are inverted to
make them visible against a dark background. To change them back, use
lighten_geoms().
}
